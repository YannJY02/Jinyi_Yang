about myself.

## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Jinyi Yang!

I'm currently a research master's student in Communication Science at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). My research interest focuses on dynamic media effects, especially how emerging technologies shape human perception and cognition.

Also, I'm passionate about using technology to empower education and increase visibility for marginalized communities.
